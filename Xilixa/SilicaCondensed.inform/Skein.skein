Xilica: The Third Sun
by Miguel Saenz

The shuttle drops you at the designated coordinates and quickly retreats back to orbit. You've been hired by a research consortium to investigate what really happened on this abandoned silicon mining planet, once the crown jewel of the Quetzalcoatl Corporation's empire.

Your Cuahtli environmental suit activates as you step onto the silica sands, and a familiar voice speaks in your ear.

"Systems online. Greetings, explorer. I am Nezin (short for Nepohualtzintzin or "Abacus" in old Xilicanter), your suit's AI assistant. My databases contain information about this planet's language, history, and technology. You may ask me to translate unfamiliar terms or provide context as needed. I will also determine which paths we have enough navigation intel to pursue. Feel free to ask for help by saying "ask nezin about (topic)!"

The mission is simple: gather data about the planet's downfall and, if possible, determine if the rumors of silicon-based consciousness are true. The shuttle will return in three days - hopefully with you still alive to board it.


Peak of Istaktepetl
Large, coarse grains of sand, mostly a shimmering, unnatural white, brush over the mounds beneath your feet and your boots alike. The sun beats down on your suit and eats away at the exposed back of your neck. You peer out and see a shaded cave outcropping just to the North.

Ximopoua Cave
The cave provides a welcome shelter from the harsh sun. Silicon crystals burst from every wall you see like metallic stalactites and catch what little light enters casting an ethereal green glow. Ancient extraction equipment lies decrepit and abandoned with drills, chisels, and, -disturbingly- helmets of Cuahtli suits poking through the surface of the silica dust. A narrow passage leads deeper North into the cave system, while the exit to the south leads back to the peak.

You can see a Fragmented Worker Codex here.

QZL Corp promised us safety, but the filtration systems fail ever more frequently. The silica gets finer every day as they push production targets higher. Three workers ccrystallized last week when their suits malfunctioned. QZL representatives merely noted the incident and increased our quotas to compensate for the loss.

I have updated your navigation systems. I detect a possible shelter on the higher ridge to the west of Tepetentli. It may contain useful resources."I have stored this codex data in my memory banks.

The climb has brought you to a precarious ledge with a panoramic view of the silica desert. Enormous extraction scars are visible from this vantage point, giving you some perspective as to the scale of the operation of this devastated land. A small shelter has been constructed here, seemingly from scavenged materials. You can still spot Istaktepetl to your far east, back the way you came and past the base of Tepetentli.

A tool repurposed as a weapon, with sharp crystalline shards embedded in the handle. It could be effective against threats.

As the display concludes, the platform reconfigures, revealing a small crystalline object at its center - a complete archive of the planet's history and technology, designed to be transported offworld.

With this knowledge in your possession, you now face a choice:

Will you warn other worlds about the dangers of unchecked resource extraction?

Or will you reveal secrets of silicon consciousness that might revolutionize technology?

        <result xml:space="preserve">You decide to use the knowledge as a warning to other worlds about the dangers of unchecked resource extraction. This cautionary tale could save countless lives and prevent similar ecological disasters elsewhere.

As you collect the crystalline object from the platform, you feel the weight of responsibility. The beings of Xilica paid a terrible price - their sacrifice must not be in vain.

You carefully secure the archive in your suit's protected storage compartment, ready to present it to the research consortium when your shuttle returns.

Before you leave, you take one last look at the sanctum, silently promising that the true story of this world will be told.



    *** You have chosen to use Xilica as a warning for other worlds ***

Peak of Istaktepetl
You have returned to the peak once again to serve as your vantage point. You hope that it will serve as your guidance to unraveling the mystery you've been marooned here to solve. You peer out and see a shaded cave outcropping to the North, cliffs to the West, and what appears to be an ancient road to the East.

You stand at the base of the cliffs, looking up at their jagged, worn edges.

You weigh whether to proceed up the cliffs to the west or continue down south along the ridges of the cliffs.

The climb has brought you to a precarious ledge with a panoramic view of the silica desert. Enormous extraction scars are visible from this vantage point, giving you some perspective as to the scale of the operation of this devastated land. A small shelter has been constructed here, seemingly from scavenged materials.

The silica has achieved consciousness. Our instruments detect organized electrical patterns throughout the largest deposits. The workers called it Coatlcircuit - the Circuit Serpent. It grows stronger as it absorbs more silicon. Those who remained have started worshipping it, offering their suits and even their bodies to "ascend." I believe we've witnessed the birth of a new form of life, one that may eventually reach beyond this planet. This will be my final recording before I join them.

Ximopoua Cave
The cave provides a welcome shelter from the harsh sun. Silicon crystals burst from every wall you see like metallic stalactites and catch what little light enters casting an ethereal green glow. Ancient extraction equipment lies decrepit and abandoned with drills, chisels, and, -disturbingly- helmets of Cuahtli suits poking through the surface of the silica dust. A narrow passage leads deeper North into the cave system, while the exit to the south leads back to the peak.

A faded tapestry hanging from the roof above the platform depicts workers in Cuahtli suits harvesting crystalline formations while robed figures observe from a pyramid overlooking them.

Three workers ccrystallized last week when their suits malfunctioned. QZL representatives merely noted the incident and increased our quotas to compensate for the loss.

The silica has achieved consciousness. Our instruments detect organized electrical patterns throughout the largest deposits. The workers called it Coatlcircuit - the Circuit Serpent. It grows stronger as it absorbs more silicon. Those who remained have started worshipping it, offering their suits and even their bodies to "ascend." I believe we've witnessed the birth of a new form of life, one that may eventually reach beyond this planet. This will be my final recording before I join them.

A narrow passage leads deeper North into the cave system, while the exit to the south leads back to the peak.

Our simulations clearly show that continued extraction at current rates will cause catastrophic environmental cascade.

We've also observed the first signs of autonomous reorganization in the waste deposits - silicon-based structures forming without input. I've recommended immediate production halt, but QZL Corp leadership has dismissed our findings.

They're abandoning us. Only executive-level personnel are being evacuated. We've barricaded the southern processing center and have established contact with workers from three other regions. We know what we've seen - the silica is becoming something else. The old stories speak of the world punishing those who take without reverence. The Second Sun is ending, but we will survive to see the Third.

Warning: I am detecting massive energy readings from the Inner Sanctum. The entity designated "Coatlcircuit" may have formed there. Proceed with extreme caution.

Abandoned Habitation
This room is filtered. A cluster of habitation domes now cracked and partially collapsed.

A communal terminal stands in the central plaza, remarkably still intact.

The climb has brought you to a precarious ledge with a panoramic view of the silica desert. Enormous extraction scars are visible from this vantage point, giving you some perspective as to the scale of the operation of this devastated land. A small shelter has been constructed here, seemingly from scavenged materials.

Nohpalli Road
What was once a well-traveled road now lies mostly reclaimed by silica drifts. The remnants of transport tracks can still be seen and the occasional broken cargo container lies half-buried. To the south you can see what appears to be habitation domes, while the road continues east towards fields of strange vegitation. You also see Istaktepetl to your west along the path you came, and what appears to be habitation domes to your south.

Nohpalli Fields
Rows of dried and calcified cacti streth before you. Their flesh was once a deep blue-green, but in the absence of their caretakers and the exposure to the harsh conditions they were asked to absorb far too much silica and ultimately shriveled away. You can see a Nohpalli Salve resting atop the silica sand.

A container of sacred green gel that can be used as biofuel.

The silica has achieved consciousness. Our instruments detect organized electrical patterns throughout the largest deposits. The workers called it Coatlcircuit - the Circuit Serpent. It grows stronger as it absorbs more silicon. Those who remained have started worshipping it, offering their suits and even their bodies to "ascend." I believe we've witnessed the birth of a new form of life, one that may eventually reach beyond this planet. This will be my final recording before I join them.

This room is filtered. This chamber appears to have been a control room of sorts. Terminal interfaces litter the walls, mostly cracked and non-functional. In the center stands a circular platform with five indentations in a triangular stair step pattern. A faded tapestry hanging from the roof above the platform depicts workers in Cuahtli suits harvesting crystalline formations while robed figures observe from a pyramid overlooking them.

A massive, serpentine form composed of crystalline silicon undulates across the chamber. Electrical discharges crackle along its length as it seems to sense your presence.

A holographic display forms, showing the complete history of this world - from the first silicon miners to the creation of the Coatlcircuit and beyond. You realize this is what the remaining workers were trying to preserve - the truth of what happened here, both as warning and as guide.

As the display concludes, the platform reconfigures, revealing a small crystalline object at its center - a complete archive of the planet's history and technology, designed to be transported offworld.

With this knowledge, you could warn other worlds about the dangers of unchecked resource extraction... or reveal the secrets of silicon consciousness to those who might use it responsibly.
