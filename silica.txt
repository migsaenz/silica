Instead of using a memory codex on the player:
	say "You insert the [noun] into your suit's interface port. After a moment, Nezin's voice speaks in your ear:[paragraph break][italic type][memory content of the noun][roman type][paragraph break]";
	if the codex id of the noun is 1:
		now the Higher Ridge is discovered;
		say "[italic type]I have updated your navigation systems. I detect a possible shelter on the higher ridge to the west of Tepetentli. It may contain useful resources.[roman type]";
	if the codex id of the noun is 2:
		now the Abandoned Habitation is discovered;
		say "[italic type]This data correlates with unusual readings I'm detecting from the abandoned worker habitation to the north of the Nohpalli Road. We should investigate there.[roman type]";
	if the codex id of the noun is 3:
		now the Teocalli Processing Center is discovered;
		say "[italic type]The evacuation records indicate that not all workers complied. A significant group barricaded themselves in the Teocalli Processing Center south of the Nohpalli Fields.[roman type]";
	if the codex id of the noun is 4:
		move the Coatlcircuit to the Inner Sanctum;
		say "[italic type]Warning: I am detecting massive energy readings from the Inner Sanctum. The entity designated 'Coatlcircuit' may have formed there. Proceed with extreme caution.[roman type]";
	if the codex id of the noun is 5:

	remove the noun from play.
